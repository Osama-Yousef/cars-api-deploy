# Lab: 34 - Back End Deployment
## Lab: API Deployment

## Overview
- It’s time to deploy!

- First steps are to make sure your Application is able to run well in a remote environment.

- Once you are confident that your Application is *deployable` then time to research deployment options.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements
- NOTE: You can use previous lab’s Application as a starting point or start from scratch.
- Modify your application to store SECRET_KEY, ALLOWED_HOSTS, DEBUG and DATABASE information in .env file.
- Add CORS capabilities to your app and whitelist allowed origins.
- All the code changes will be in settings.py so check the demo code for CORS and Env related lines.

## Deployment Requirements
- Research web hosting sites capable of working with Docker
- NOTE no money is required for this lab but you may choose to create a trial account.
  * But you are responsible for making sure you don’t hit with charges when trial is complete.


## Implementation Notes
- You are not required to use Poetry since the requirements.txt is being supplied.
- However if you run into issues with supplied requirements.txt then you are responsible for rebuilding.
